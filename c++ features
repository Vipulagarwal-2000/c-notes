c++ is high level language and  OOPs supporting language. C++ give a high level of control over system resources and memory. 

It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. 

It makes programming easy for programmers to switch to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#.

Games devlopment
C++ used for game development and companies use it as their first choice to develop gaming systems because C++ is very close to the machine so 
It can easily manipulate resources and able to built complex 3D games, multiplayer game, etc. Unreal game engine make games using C++.

C++ is used in developing browsers, operating systems, and applications, as well as in-game programming, software engineering, data structures, etc.

It is an imperative and a compiled language which means it is statistically typed.C++ has a strong type system, which means that variables have a specific type and that
type must be respected in all operations performed on that variable

C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.).

C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. 
which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.

C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables)

##Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a large set of pre-written algorithms and data structures that can be used to simplify your code and make it more efficient.

C++ is a compiled language, which means that code is transformed into machine code before it is executed. 
This can result in faster execution times and improved performance compared to interpreted languages like Python.

Machine Independent
A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however, they are machine-independent. 
Let us understand this feature of C++ with the help of an example. Suppose you have written a piece of code that can run on Linux/Windows/Mac OSx which makes the 
C++ Machine Independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot run on different operating systems.


Dynamic Memory Allocation
When the program executes in C++ then the variables are allocated the dynamical heap space. Inside the functions, 
the variables are allocated in the stack space. Many times, We are not aware in advance how much memory is needed to store particular 
information in a defined variable and the size of required memory can be determined at run time.

use this to get the array size from user input.

Memory Management
C++ allows us to allocate the memory of a variable or an array in run time. This is known as Dynamic Memory Allocation.
In C++, the memory must be de-allocated dynamically allocated memory manually after it is of no use.
The allocation and deallocation of the memory can be done using the new and delete operators respectively.

Multi-threading ?? i really dont get it

Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking and multitasking is a feature that allows your system to execute two or more programs concurrently. 
In general, there are two sorts of multitasking: process-based and thread-based.
## (need to work on process and thread multitasking)Process-based multitasking handles the concurrent execution of programs. Thread-based multitasking deals with the multiprogramming of pieces of an equivalent program.
A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that will run concurrently. Each part of such a program is named a thread, and every thread defines a separate path of execution.
C++ doesn’t contain any built-in support for multithreaded applications. Instead, it relies entirely upon the OS to supply this feature

Namespace is used by C++, to avoid name collisions.

It is the most primarily used language in competitive programming as far as facts go. Most of the extremely rated coders typically use C++ for cryptography.
